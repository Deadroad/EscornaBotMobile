# Installation
First of all, please, install React Native following this guidelines: [https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). You need to have installed [node](https://nodejs.org/es/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) (node package manager). Usually installing node you don't need to install npm, is included in the package.

Recommended install `react-native-cli` with `npm install -g react-native-cli` globally too.

**Essential tools**: `node`, `npm` and `react-native` command line client. To make possible compile for each platform, iOS and Android, you must have XCode, Command Line Tools and Android SDK (with last java updated, gradle... I recommend Android Studio to automatize this questions).

1. Clone repository with `git clone` or some Github GUI.
2. Inside app directory, root, execute `npm install` and wait for all node_modules wass installed.
3. Execute app with `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` for each platform. If you preffer execute under XCode or Android Studio, it's ok.
